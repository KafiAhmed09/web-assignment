    <p>In the signage industry, neon signs are electric signs lighted by long luminous gas-discharge tubes that contain
        rarefied neon or other gases. They are the most common use for neon lighting, which was first demonstrated in a
        modern form in December 1910 by Georges Claude at the Paris Motor Show.</p>
